            for the TSD 2023 conference proceedings

						Rel. 2021-02-15
	 
=================================================================

Template
--------

We kindly ask you to use the provided template "tsd2023.tex" when
preparing your camera-ready submission. The required fields are
marked with "TSD 2023" comments. Please, do not delete these
comments as they may be used later by the the proceedings editor.

Further notes
-------------

* All images/figures should be either in EPS or PDF format. If you
use a bitmap image, you can embed it into EPS, e.g., using the free
ImageMagick "convert" tool as follows

  $convert -resample 300x300 input.png eps2:output.eps

or you can use your favourite graphic tool (e.g. Inkscape).

* We kindly ask you to clean up the manuscript by removing
all comments from the body of your manuscript.

* When submitting the manuscript, all we need is the *.tex files,
the figures (*.pdf/*.eps), the bibtex file (if you use bibtex),
plus the final PDF of your article. It is not necessary to attach
other files (splncs04.bst, llncs.cls, *.aux, *.bbl, *.log, *.blg,
and others).

* We will appreciate if you also attach the filled and signed
Copyright Form (scanned as PDF, in the optimal case). This is the
preferred way of delivering this document.

Should you have any questions or comments, please, send an e-mail
to tsd2023@tsdconference.org.

Thank you for your co-operation.
Yours sincerely,

TSD 2023 Organizing Committee
TSD 2023 Proceedings Editors
