			a high-quality database of syntactic structures for
			Hungarian that can serve as a golden standard to further
			research in linguistics and computational language
			processing. The treebank currently contains full syntactic
			parsing of about 82,000 sentences, which is the result of
			accurate manual annotation. Current paper describes the
			linguistic theory as well as the actual method used in the
			annotation process. In addition, the application of the
			treebank for the training of automated syntactic parsers is

		pipeline for Hungarian called emtsv. It integrates
		Hungarian NLP tools in a framework whose individual modules
		can be developed or replaced independently and allows new
		ones to be added. The design also allows convenient
		investigation and manual correction of the data flow from
		one module to another. The improvements we publish include
		effective communication between the modules and support of
		the use of individual modules both in the chain and
		standing alone. Our goals are accomplished using extended
		tsv (tab separated values) files, a simple, uniform,
		generic and self-documenting input/output format. Our
		vision is maintaining the system for a long time and making
		it easier for external developers to fit their own modules
		into the system, thus sharing existing competencies in the
		field of processing Hungarian, a mid-resourced language.

development of our Treebank. Second, mention is made of
existing dependency corpora for other languages. Third, we
present the steps of converting the Szeged Treebank into
dependency-tree format: from the originally
phrase-structured treebank, we produced dependency trees by
automatic conversion, checked and corrected them thereby
creating the first manually annotated dependency corpus for
Hungarian. We also go into detail about the two major sets
of problems, i.e. coordination and predicative nouns and
adjectives. Fourth, we give statistics on the treebank: by
now, we have completed the annotation of business news,
newspaper articles, legal texts and texts in informatics,
at the same time, we are planning to convert the entire
corpus into dependency tree format. Finally, we give some
hints on the applicability of the system: the present
database may be utilized ― among others ― in
information extraction and machine translation as well."

We also introduce experiments on this manually annotated corpus for evaluating automatic conversion and the added value of language-specific, i.e. non-universal, annotations. Our results reveal that converting to universal dependencies is not necessarily trivial, moreover, using language-specific morphological features may have an impact on overall performance.",

morphosyntactic annotation of human language, which to date

theory of the UD framework, which draws on a long tradition
of typologically oriented grammatical theories. Grammatical
relations between words are centrally used to explain how
predicate–argument structures are encoded
morphosyntactically in different languages while
morphological features and part-of-speech classes give the
properties of words. We argue that this theory is a good
basis for crosslinguistically consistent annotation of
typologically diverse languages in a way that supports
computational natural language understanding as well as
broader linguistic studies.}",

diverse languages realizing that schema. We have
implemented several improvements to the extraction pipeline
which creates most of our data, so that it is both more
complete and more correct. We have added 66 new languages,
as well as new parts of speech for 12 languages. We have
also amended the schema in several ways. Finally, we
present three new community tools: two to validate data for
resource creators, and one to make morphological data
available from the command line. UniMorph is based at the
Center for Language and Speech Processing (CLSP) at Johns
